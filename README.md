# FrostBite

A simple webpage designed to aid global travelers as they plan for weather events and secure rental lodging. 

## Description

The motivation for this project came from our desires as travelers to find resturants in our own areas and in areas that we are traveling. Also to go along with that, we wanted to make sure it was known to the user what the weather was like in those cities to better choose where to eat. The problem this solves deals with people who are spontaneous and love to try new places to eat and this gives them the best oppourtunity to do so and have the tools they need to aid in their decision making. What we learned in this project is how to manage an application within a group, make API calls from two different API's. We also learned how to approve, amend, and commit team-based coding changed within GitHub. 


## Installation

To install and develop this project, we first had to create the repository and add ourselves into the repo as a team. Then we cloned the repo to pur own separate machines. After that we divided up the tasks and developed our own branches on the repo and pushed code up to the main branch periodically once finished and approved. After that we had to make sure that changes were made periodically making sure that when updates were made to the HTML that those changes reciprocated properly in the javascript and kept the application running and functioning. Once all the logic and HTML were to our liking, we then finished all commits related to the files, readme, and assets. Once everything was taken care of and the application worked locally, we then used GitHub pages to push the repo live as a webpage. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.

# FrostBite


## Description
---
The motivation for this project came from our desires as travelers to find restaurants in our own areas and in areas that we are traveling. Also to go along with that, we wanted to make sure it was known to the user what the weather was like in those cities to better choose where to eat. The problem this solves deals with people who are spontaneous and love to try new places to eat and this gives them the best oppourtunity to do so and have the tools they need to aid in their decision making. What we learned in this project is how to manage an application within a group, make API calls from two different API's. We also learned how to approve, amend, and commit team-based coding changed within GitHub. 


## Installation
---
To install and develop this project, we first had to create the repository and add ourselves into the repo as a team. Then we cloned the repo to pur own separate machines. After that we divided up the tasks and developed our own branches on the repo and pushed code up to the main branch periodically once finished and approved. After that we had to make sure that changes were made periodically making sure that when updates were made to the HTML that those changes reciprocated properly in the javascript and kept the application running and functioning. Once all the logic and HTML were to our liking, we then finished all commits related to the files, readme, and assets. Once everything was taken care of and the application worked locally, we then used GitHub pages to push the repo live as a webpage.
